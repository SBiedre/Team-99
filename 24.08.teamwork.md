```py
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Initialize and train the DecisionTreeClassifier
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
prediction_results = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, prediction_results)
report = classification_report(y_test, prediction_results)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

What is Cross-Validation?

Cross-validation is like giving your model multiple tests to make sure it’s good at making predictions. Instead of just splitting your data into one training set and one test set, you split your data into several smaller parts (or "folds").

Here’s how it works:

    Split the Data: Imagine you have 10 people in a line. You split them into 5 groups (called "folds"), each with 2 people.

    Train and Test Multiple Times: You train your model on 4 of these groups and test it on the remaining group. Then, you repeat this process 5 times, each time using a different group for testing and the rest for training.

    Average the Results: After testing the model 5 times, you look at how well it did each time, and then you calculate the average score. This gives you a more reliable measure of how well your model will do on new data.

Why Use Cross-Validation?

    More Reliable: It helps you know how well your model will perform on unseen data by testing it multiple times.
    Prevents Overfitting: By testing multiple times, you can see if your model is just memorizing the training data or if it’s genuinely learning something useful.

    
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score

# Perform 10-fold cross-validation
k_fold = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=k_fold, scoring='accuracy')

print(f"Cross-Validation Scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean Cross-Validation Score: {cv_scores.mean()}")
```
