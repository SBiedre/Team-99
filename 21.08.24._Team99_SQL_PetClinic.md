*Male cat names that start with "S" who are aged less than 7 years:

SELECT petid, name, ownerid FROM Pets WHERE kind='Cat' and name GLOB '*S*' and age<7 and sex='male';

*Pets that have letter "b" as third in their name :

SELECT * FROM PETS WHERE name LIKE '__b__';

*Counting the number of pets each owner has:
SELECT o.Name, COUNT(p.PetID) AS NumPets
FROM Owners o
LEFT JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID
GROUP BY o.OwnerID;

*Who has the most pets (It's Barbara):
SELECT o.Name, COUNT(p.PetID) AS NumPets
FROM Owners o
LEFT JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID
GROUP BY o.OwnerID
ORDER BY NumPets DESC
LIMIT 1;

*Barbara owns all these pets:
SELECT p.PetID, p.Name, p.Kind
FROM Pets p
WHERE p.OwnerID = (
    SELECT o.OwnerID
    FROM Owners o
    LEFT JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID
    GROUP BY o.OwnerID
    ORDER BY COUNT(p.PetID) DESC
    LIMIT 1
);

*Oldest pet and their owner:
SELECT p.Name, p.Age AS PetAge, o.Name AS OwnerName
FROM Pets p
JOIN Owners o ON p.OwnerID = o.OwnerID
ORDER BY p.Age DESC
LIMIT 1;

*The longest name:
SELECT Name, LENGTH(Name) AS NameLength
FROM Pets
ORDER BY NameLength DESC
LIMIT 1;

*5 random pets:
SELECT * FROM Pets ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5;

*Who is the "Cat lady"? Turns out it's gentleman named Lionel and his five cats:
SELECT o.OwnerID, o.Name, COUNT(p.PetID) AS NumCats
FROM Owners o
LEFT JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID
WHERE p.Kind = 'Cat'
GROUP BY o.OwnerID
ORDER BY NumCats DESC
LIMIT 1;

*And Lionel's cats are:
SELECT p.PetID, p.Name, p.Kind
FROM Pets p
WHERE p.OwnerID = (
    SELECT o.OwnerID
    FROM Owners o
    LEFT JOIN Pets p ON o.OwnerID = p.OwnerID
    WHERE p.Kind = 'Cat'
    GROUP BY o.OwnerID
    ORDER BY COUNT(p.PetID) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
AND p.Kind = 'Cat';

*Average age of pets for each pet type:
SELECT Kind, AVG(Age) AS AvgAge
FROM Pets
GROUP BY Kind;

* Finds duplicates in names:
SELECT Name, COUNT(*) 
FROM Pets 
GROUP BY Name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
