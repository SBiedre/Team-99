Hey! This is **Team 99**!

We are four fantastic ladies:
- Sandra B (Github manager and team lead)
- Madara 
- Linda Eislere
- Triinu S
  
**Little info about ourselves:**
- My name is **Sandra B**, I live in Riga and in Skulte.
I am a preschool teacher, but also have previous experience
in implementation and supervision of financial and environmental
investment projects. Currently I am riding the emotional
rollercoaster of learning to code along with other fantastic ladies that I have met along this journey.
- My name is **Madara**. I live in Iecava. I had first introduction to programming in high school,
where I learned C++. Now after these 3 months, I would say I understand Java better than Python.
But everything is still in progress, that might change after some time.
So I am excited to see where this journey will take me.
- I am **Linda** and can brag that I have learned Norwegian in 6 months.
So the next challenge is to learn programming from scratch.
Really interesting so far and the best hope is to postpone the dementia in elderly age.
- My name is **Triinu** and I live in Tallinn. Learning coding was a little bit familiar
for me since I have learned HTML and JavaScript in KhanAcademy platform. I thought that I know what
to expect from this program, but WoTech journey has been a rollercoaster with joy and anxiety
